This is a simple Language Translator web application built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The app allows users to translate text from one language to another by making use of the MyMemory API.

The following files are included in this project:

countries.js: This file contains a JavaScript object with a list of language codes and their corresponding names.

index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the app. It includes two text areas, two select tags, and an exchange button that allows users to swap the languages they want to translate from and to.

script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that fetches data from the MyMemory API, performs the translations, and implements the functionality of the app.

style.css: This file contains the styling for the app.

To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Enter the text you want to translate into the "Enter text" text area. Select the language you want to translate from and the language you want to translate to using the two select tags. Click the "Translate Text" button and the translated text will appear in the "Translation" text area.

Additionally, users can use the icons to either copy the text to the clipboard or have the text spoken out loud.

Note that the app is limited to the languages supported by the MyMemory API, which are listed in the countries.js file.
